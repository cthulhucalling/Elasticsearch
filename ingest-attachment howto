Indexing attachments

Stop Elasticsearch
1. Install ingest-attachment plugin
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment
    
2. Start Elasticsearch

3. Build a pipeline to the ingest-attachment plugin
    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" "localhost:9200/_ingest/pipeline/mcboatface" -d'
         {
          "description":"Extract attachment information",
          "processors":[
               {
                "attachment":{
                     "field":"data",
                     "indexed_chars":-1
                 }
               }
          ]
        }'
   This will create a pipeline called "mcboatface" that will pipe the data to the ingest-attachment plugin. 
   Attachment data will go into the "data" field (actually the "attachment.data" field as we will see later")
   
   4. Attachments to be indexed must be Base64 encoded before going into ES.
        echo "Lorum ipsum blah blah blah" > test.txt
        base64 test.txt
        TG9ydW0gaXBzdW0gYmxhaCBibGFoIGJsYWgK
        
   5. PUT the data into ES:
        curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" "localhost:9200/<my index>/_doc/<id>?pipeline=mcboatface" -d'
             {
              "data":"TG9ydW0gaXBzdW0gYmxhaCBibGFoIGJsYWgK"
             }'
   6. Now the attachment contents have been indexed and is searchable. The key here is that we're matching "attachment.content":
      curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" "localhost:9200/test/_search?pretty" -d'
       { "query":{
         "match":{"attachment.content":"blah"}
        }
      }'
      
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.45207188,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "test",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.45207188,
        "_source" : {
          "data" : "TG9ydW0gaXBzdW0gYmxhaCBibGFoIGJsYWgK",
          "attachment" : {
            "content_type" : "text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1",
            "language" : "is",
            "content" : "Lorum ipsum blah blah blah",
            "content_length" : 28
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}


For large files, Curl is going to bitch that the arugment list is too long.
base64 -w 0 <filename> > test.json. Need the -w0 otherwise base64 will put in line breaks every 76 characters
Edit the file so it looks like JSON:
{"data":"<base 64 string>"}
Then:
    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" "localhost:9200/test/_docs/2?pipeline=mcboatface" -d @test.json
